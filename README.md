# Trading-BOT
Trading BOT done in python

For the BOT i will be using the Alpaca API because is one of the only API's that are available in my country of residence. Also, it is very developer friendly and will be great for the project.


for the project to work you might install pandas and requests like this.

First you need to have installed pip in your computer, it comes with almast every version of Pyhton3. After knowing it is installed, run these commands into your promtp.

    Windows:
    ctrl + R
    type cmd
    enter

    MAC OS:
    cmd + space
    type terminal

    then run: 
    "pip install pandas"
    "pip install requests"

If there is an error that says "pip is not a known command" try by typing "pip3" instead of "pip"


For the BOT to work you might install the requirements if they are not in your pc already.
    
    pip install -r requirements.tx

This commando will install everything automatically.

------------!IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR JUAN MARTIN------------
- The secret key changes if you start working on another pc. Remeber to regenerate it.
- The API key from alpha_vantage is not necessary it was only for tests.
